// Split out of config.js, which holds how things BEHAVE. The test for whether
// something belongs here: does it change when you add a level or a crop, or
// when you tune how something feels? Growth speed, sway, dim alpha and camera
// follow are tuning and stay in config.js. The running order of the farms is
// content and lives here.
//
// ── WHAT A LEVEL IS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// One object per level, holding its map and its crop together.
//
// They used to be two things in two places: an entry in LEVELS naming a map,
// and a position in CROP_CYCLE naming a crop. They were matched by INDEX and
// wrapped SEPARATELY — 7 maps against 11 crops meant the pairing drifted every
// time round, so the same field grew something different on each pass and no
// one could say what a level was without counting entries in two lists.
//
// Now one line is one level and they cannot come apart.
//
//   FILE   path to the Tiled .tmj — field layout, canals, crop cells, props
//   CROPS  what each MARKER on the map's crops layer grows:
//
//            CROPS: { 1: 'tomato', 2: 'potato' }
//
//          The key is the marker's number in markers.tsx, counted from 1 — the
//          same number you paint with in Tiled. A cell painted with marker 2
//          grows what 2 names here; a marker the level does not name grows
//          nothing and says so in the console.
//
//          This is how a level holds MORE THAN ONE crop: the field is mixed by
//          painting, and which patch is which is decided here rather than in
//          the map. The HIGHEST marker a level names is treated as its own
//          crop — the one it adds to what came before — so that is what flies
//          to the roster when it is finished.
//   CROP   ONE crop, grown by EVERY marker the map paints — 1, 2, 3, whatever
//          is there. Not shorthand for marker 1: a map already drawn with
//          several markers would then come up with most of its field bare for
//          saying nothing wrong. So a level names markers only when it wants
//          variety, and until it does, whatever is painted grows its crop.
//          Ignored when CROPS is present.
//   RANCH  optional: makes this level an animal farm. Two kinds:
//
//            { SPECIES: 'pig', COUNT: 8 }   scattered — eight of them, put
//                                           anywhere that is not canal
//            { SPECIES: 'cow' }             placed — one per point on the map's
//                                           'ranch' object layer, named for the
//                                           way it faces (`cow_e`, or `_e` to
//                                           take this level's species)
//
//          COUNT is what tells them apart: with it the herd is scattered,
//          without it the map is asked. Either way each animal walks on as the
//          water reaches the cell it stands on, so the herd fills in behind the
//          flood. The species is a block in ANIMALS.SPECIES (config.js).
//   COST   optional: work to cut this level, overriding COST[] by position
//
// The key names are the ones the code already reads, so binding the crop in
// costs nothing elsewhere — map loading and the debug report are untouched.
//
// Loaded BEFORE config.js (see index.html), which reads LEVEL_DATA below.

        // ── WHAT A CLASS DOES ───────────────────────────────────────────────
        // Everything a class changes about a crop, declared once. Nothing in
        // the game asks "is this a tree" — it asks what the crop's class says
        // about the one trait it cares about, and a class that says nothing
        // gets the default in the asking code.
        //
        // THIS IS WHAT MAKES A NEW CROP ONE LINE. Adding a peach means naming
        // its class above and nothing else: it picks up the size, the bare
        // ground and the stillness from here, because those belong to trees
        // rather than to any particular tree.
        //
        //   TILLED        a worked-soil patch under the plant. Off for turf,
        //                 which is not worked ground, and for trees, which are
        //                 perennial — and whose canopy hides the patch anyway.
        //   SWAY          rocks when the farmer brushes past. A stem bends; a
        //                 trunk does not. Trees still shake when picked — that
        //                 is a separate force and asks for it explicitly.
        //   STAGE_SPREAD  widens at maturity (CROP_STAGE_SCALE). It exists so a
        //                 mature vegetable can spill past its own cell. A tree
        //                 is already several tiles wide, and spreading it
        //                 further mostly swells the fruit, which reads as the
        //                 camera moving in.
        //   SHAKE         what the pick's shake looks like: 'bend' rotates the
        //                 plant about its stem, 'squash' compresses it in place.
        //                 A tree squashes because its shadow sits under the
        //                 pivot and is wide, so rotating swings the shadow.
        //   SCATTER       planted off the cell centre, and sometimes twice, so
        //                 the field has no rows. Right for turf, which nobody
        //                 sowed in lines; wrong for anything someone planted.

        // A multiplier on the plant's drawn size. 1 — the default — makes a
        // crop exactly one tile wide before the growth stages scale it.
        //
        // WHY TREES NEED IT. A crop sheet's frame WIDTH is mapped to one tile
        // whatever its pixel size, so every crop ends up the same size on screen
        // and drawing a tree bigger inside its frame changes nothing. With the
        // farmer a fixed 1.9 tiles on every farm, an orchard came out the same
        // height as a tomato patch and read as a field of bushes.
        //
        // 2.0 IS THE CEILING FOR THE EXISTING ART, and it is not arbitrary: the
        // growth stages multiply this by 1.3 at maturity, so 2.0 draws a
        // 128x256 frame at exactly 128x256 — its native pixels, nothing
        // stretched. Anything above starts upscaling and the tree goes soft.
        //
        // At that size the frame stands 5.2 tiles tall against a 1.9-tile
        // farmer, so how tall the TREE looks is down to how much of the frame
        // the drawing fills. Fill the frame and it reads at roughly twice his
        // height, which is what an orchard wants.
        //
        // For anything bigger the frames have to be re-exported at 256 wide;
        // then a scale of 3 draws at 186px from 256 and is still downsampled.
        // PER-CROP OVERRIDES ONLY. A class already carries the size its crops
        // normally draw at — trees take 2.0 from CLASS_TRAITS — so this table
