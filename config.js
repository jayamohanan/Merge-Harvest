            //        drive clear of the level before the level can end, because
            //        a stopper is dropped on the boundary to hold the water and
            //        a wall cannot be placed through the belt. So: overrun the
            //        level by OVERRUN_TILES, get the belt out, drop the wall,
            //        pull the wall below, and the whole length floods at once.
